## 📌 Project Title
AI Chatbot Development Using Python and Free Tools or APIs

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and develop a simple AI-based chatbot system in Python that can:
- Interact with users via text input
- Generate logical responses using AI/ML techniques
- Be developed using only **free** tools and APIs

---

## 📦 Features

### ✅ Core Features:
- Text-based input and output
- Logical response generation (using rule-based or ML-based logic)
- Built using Python in Visual Studio Code

### ✨ Optional Features (if implemented):
- Voice input/output (via free libraries)
- Web interface (Flask or Streamlit)
- Chat history tracking

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Libraries:** 
  - `nltk`, `random`, `re`, or any free chatbot-related libraries
  - Optional: `SpeechRecognition`, `pyttsx3`, `Flask`, `streamlit`
- **APIs:** Only free/open-source ones (if any used)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Set up Python environment in VS Code.
2. Designed chatbot logic using:
   - Rule-based if-else responses or
   - AI/ML-based methods (optional)
3. Built a simple text interface (command-line or GUI).
4. Ensured chatbot responds logically to 5–10+ sample user queries.
5. Added optional features if time allowed (voice, UI, history).
6. Thoroughly tested and commented code for clarity.
